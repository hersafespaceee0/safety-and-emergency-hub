## Project Overview

Kenya faces significant safety challenges, including slow emergency response (only 10% of Kenyans have timely ambulance access), limited access to verified emergency contacts, and low disaster preparedness. The Safety and Emergency Hub solves these by providing:

- A platform for reporting emergencies with geolocation and multimedia.
- Real-time alerts for local incidents (e.g., floods, protests).
- A verified directory of hospitals, police, and ambulances.
- Community-driven response via trained volunteers.
- Safety education tailored to Kenyan contexts (e.g., flood preparedness).

The app is mobile-first, supports offline access, and integrates with M-Pesa and Safaricom APIs for seamless payments and notifications, targeting Kenyaâ€™s 90% mobile internet users.

## Features

- User authentication (signup, login, logout).
- Display active alerts, emergency contacts, and safety tips.
- Submit and view volunteer requests.
- Geolocation-based alert reporting (client-side).
- Planned: SMS alerts, USSD support, panic button.

- **Incident Reporting**: Report emergencies (e.g., accidents, crimes) with photos, videos, and GPS coordinates.
- **Geo-Based Alerts**: Receive SMS or in-app notifications about nearby incidents.
- **Emergency Directory**: Searchable database of verified hospitals, police stations, and ambulances.
- **Community Responders**: Connect with trained volunteers for rapid response, with a trust-based rating system.
- **Safety Education**: Interactive tutorials on first aid, fire safety, and disaster preparedness, gamified with quizzes.
- **Panic Button**: One-tap feature to alert contacts with userâ€™s location.
- **Offline Mode**: Access cached contacts and tips without internet.
- **USSD Support**: Basic features (e.g., emergency contacts) accessible via USSD for rural feature phone users.
- **Multilingual Interface**: Supports English, Swahili, and local languages (e.g., Kikuyu, Luo).

## Tech Stack
